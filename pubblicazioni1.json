			"abstract": "Nowadays home automation, with its increased availability, reliability and with its ever reducing costs is gaining momentum and is starting to become a viable solution for enabling people with disabilities to autonomously interact with their homes and to better communicate with other people. However, especially for people with severe mobility impairments, there is still a lack of tools and interfaces for effective control and interaction with home automation systems, and general-purpose solutions are seldom applicable due to the complexity, asynchronicity, time dependent behavior, and safety concerns typical of the home environment. \r\nThis paper focuses on user-environment interfaces based on the eye tracking technology, which often is the only viable interaction modality for  users as such. We propose an eye-based interface tackling the specific requirements of smart environments, already outlined in a public Recommendation issued by the COGAIN European Network of Excellence. The proposed interface has been implemented as a software prototype based on the ETU universal driver, thus being potentially able  to run on a variety of eye trackers, and it is compatible with a wide set of smart home technologies, handled by the Domotic OSGi Gateway. A first interface evaluation, with user testing sessions, has been carried and results show that the interface is quite effective and usable without discomfort by people with almost regular eye movement control.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Buildings account for a relevant fraction of the energy consumed by a country, up to 20-40% of the yearly energy consumption. If only electricity is considered, the fraction is even bigger, reaching around 73% of the total electricity consumption, equally divided into residential and commercial dwellings.  Building and Home Automation have a potential to profoundly impact current and future buildings� energy ef?ciency by informing users about their current consumption patterns, by suggesting more ef?cient behaviors, and by pro-actively changing/modifying user actions for reducing the associated energy wastes. In this paper we investigate the capability of an automated home to automatically, and timely, inform users about energy consumption, by harvesting opinions of residential inhabitants on energy feedback interfaces. We report here the results of an on-line survey, involving nearly a thousand participants, about feedback mechanisms suggested by the research community, with the goal of understanding what feedback is felt by home inhabitants easier to understand, more likely to be used, and more effective in promoting behavior changes.  Contextually, we also collect and distill users� attitude towards in-home energy displays and their preferred locations, gathering useful insights on user-driven design of more effective in-home energy displays.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "Intelligent environments, such as smart homes or domotic systems, have the potential to support people in many of their ordinary activities, by allowing complex control strategies for managing various capabilities of a house or a building: lights, doors, temperature, power and energy, music, etc. Such environments, typically, provide these control strategies by means of computers, touch screen panels, mobile phones, tablets, or In-House Displays. An unobtrusive and typically wearable device, like a bracelet or a wrist watch, that lets users perform various operations in their homes and to receive notifications from the environment, could strenghten the interaction with such systems, in particular for those people not accustomed to computer systems (e.g., elderly) or in contexts where they are not in front of a screen. Moreover, such wearable devices reduce the technological gap introduced in the environment by home automation systems, thus permitting a higher level of acceptance in the daily activities and improving the interaction between the environment and its inhabitants. In this paper, we introduce the dWatch, an off-the-shelf personal wearable notification and control device, integrated in an intelligent platform for domotic systems, designed to optimize the way people use the environment, and built as a wrist watch so that it is easily accessible, worn by people on a regular basis and unobtrusive.",

			"abstract": "A Smart Environment is an environment enriched with disappearing devices, acting together to form an �intelligent entity�. In such environments, the computing power pervades the space where the user lives, so it becomes particularly important to investigate the user�s perspective in interacting with her surrounding. Interaction, in fact, occurs when a human performs some kind of activity using any computing technology: in this case, the computing technology has an intelligence of its own and can potentially be everywhere. There is no well-defined interaction situation or context, and interaction can happen casually or accidentally.\nThe objective of this dissertation is to improve the interaction between such complex and different entities: the human and the Smart Environment. To reach this goal, this thesis presents four different and innovative approaches to address some of the identified key challenges. Such approaches, then, are validated with four corresponding software solutions, integrated with a Smart Environment, that I have developed and tested with end-users. Taken together, the proposed solutions enable a better interaction between diverse users and their intelligent environments, provide a solid set of requirements, and can serve as a baseline for further investigation on this emerging topic.",

Smart metering and energy management system can be hardly afforded by residential homes, for their cost and the required granularity. Empowering smart homes with suitable power consumption models allows to estimate, in real-time, the current home consumption on the basis of currently active devices. In this paper we introduce an ontology based power consumption model (PowerOnt) for smart homes, and we discuss some application use cases where the proposed approach may successfully be exploited. Results show that the modeling approach has the potential to support energy efficiency measures into residential homes with few or no metering devices.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "The design of smart homes, buildings and environments currently suffers from a low maturity of available methodologies and tools. Technologies, devices and protocols strongly bias the design process towards vertical integration, and more flexible solutions based on separation of design concerns are seldom applied. As a result, the current landscape of smart environments is mostly populated by defectively designed solutions where application requirements (e.g., end-user functionality) are too often mixed and intertwined with technical requirements (e.g., managing the network of devices). A mature and effective design process must, instead, rely on a clear separation between the application layer and the underlying enabling technologies, to enable effective design reuse. The role of smart gateways is to enable this separation of concerns and to provide an abstracted view of available automation technology to higher software layers.\nThis paper presents a blueprint for the information technology (IT) architecture of smart buildings that builds on top of established software engineering practices, such as model-driven development and semantic representation, and that avoids many pitfalls inherent in legacy approaches. The paper will also present a representative use case where the approach has been applied and the corresponding modeling and software tools.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "In the era of green energy and smart grids, the ability to access energy information and effectively analyze such data to extract key performance indicators is a crucial factor for successful building management. Energy data can in fact be exploited both in long-term policy adaptation and in shorter term habits modification, providing the basis for stable improvements of the overall efficiency of buildings and dwellings. To reach the ambitious goal of actually improving how buildings consume energy, four main challenges emerge from literature: (a) lack of skills and experience of energy managers, (b) complex and disparate data sets, which are currently blocking decision making processes, (c) mostly-manual work-flows that struggle to find relevant information into overwhelming streams of data sourced by monitoring systems, and (d) lack of collaborations between organizational departments. This paper provides deeper insights on these challenges, by investigating the kind of analysis currently performed by energy managers (in Italy) and the expectations they have if required to reason about systems that will be available within the next five years, and proposes design recommendations for next generation energy intelligence systems.",

This paper aims at analyzing how the IoT can improve proximity interactions by developing a case study in an exhibition area (tradeshow), with the goal of enhancing participants' and exhibitors' experience.\r\nStarting from the analysis of existing works, we designed a scenario to identify IoT-enabled application features for both participants and exhibitors. We propose a modular architecture able to provide different services to all stakeholders: it offers a baseline for exhibitors who want to provide new interactive services to participants (e.g., to control some exhibited device) and some social services to participants for interacting among themselves and with exhibitors.

This paper presents a smart notification system that uses machine learning algorithms to adequately manage incoming notifications. According to context awareness and user habits, the system decides: a) who should receive an incoming notification; b) what is the best moment to show the notification to the chosen user(s); c) on which device(s)\r\nthe chosen user(s) should receive the notification; d) which is the best way to notify the incoming notification. After the design of a general architecture, as a first step in building such a system, three different machine learning algorithms were compared in the task of establishing the best device on which the incoming notification should be delivered. The algorithms were applied to a dataset derived from real data provided by the MIT Media Laboratory Reality Mining project, enriched with additional synthetic information.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "Due to the increasing spread of location-aware applications, developers interest in user location estimation has grown in recent years. As users spend the majority of their time in few meaningful places (i.e., groups of near locations that can be considered as a unique place, such as home, school or the workplace), this paper presents a new energy efficient method to estimate user presence in a meaningful place. Specifically, instead of using commonly used but energy hungry methods such as GPS and network positioning techniques, the proposed method applies a Machine Learning algorithm based on Decision Trees, to predict the user presence in a meaningful place by collecting and analyzing: a) user activity, b) information from received notifications (receipt time, generating service, sender-receiver relationship), and c) device status (battery level and ringtone mode). The results demonstrate that, using 20 days of training data and testing the system with data coming from 14 persons, the accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) is 89.40% (standard deviation: 8.27%) with a precision of 89.04% and a recall of 89.40%. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the importance of each considered feature, by comparing the prediction accuracy obtained with different combinations of features.",

			"abstract": "Programming environments for end-user personalization in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly common. They allow users to define simple IoT applications, i.e., connections between different IoT devices and services. Unfortunately, the adopted representation models are highly technology-dependent, e.g., they often categorize devices and services by manufacturer or brand. Such an approach is not suitable to face the expected growth of the IoT, nor it allows to adapt to yet undiscovered IoT services. In this paper, we present a generic and technology-independent representation for IoT end-user programming environments. The aim of this \"high-level\" representation is to allow end-users to create abstract IoT applications that adapt to different contextual situations. We preliminary evaluated the representation by comparing it with the one used by existing programming environments in a user study with 10 participants. Results show that the representation is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities. The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts.",

In this paper, an approach for enabling \"easier\" composition of real-time data processing pipelines in smart cities is presented, exploiting a visual and block-based design approach, similar to the one adopted in the Scratch programming language for elementary school students. The proposed approach encompasses both a graphical editor and a sound methodology and workflow, to allow city operators to effectively design, develop, test, and deploy their own data processing pipelines.

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Energy consumption and performance assessment of Smart Cities must consider different levels and various sub-domains. A comprehensive energy profile of a city, in fact, should work at the city, district, and building levels. At the same time and for each level, it should take into account both electrical and thermal consumptions, and gather these information from a plethora of different sensors and from various stakeholders (i.e., citizens, utilities, policy makers, and energy providers). Current modeling approaches for this context address each level and domain separately, thus preventing a structured and comprehensive approach to a unified energy representation. Moreover, current approaches make it difficult to keep the consistency between the energetic data through levels, sub-domains, and across stakeholders. Starting from an analysis of ontologies at the state-of-the-art, this paper shows how DogOnt can be used as a foundation towards a shared and unified model for such a context. DogOnt was firstly developed in 2008 and withstands over 8 years of usage without major failures and shortcomings. We discuss successful design choices and adaptations, which kept the model up-to-date and increasingly adopted in such a mid-term time frame for energy representation in Smart Cities.",

AwareNotifications is powered by Semantic Web technologies. By directly exploiting user preferences in the semantic reasoning process, the system is able to identify suitable device(s), modality, and moment(s) to deliver the incoming user notifications.

			"abstract": "The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and programming languages make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. Perforce, Software Engineering challenges are even more difficult to address by novice programmers. Previous research focused on identifying the most challenging issues that novice programmers experience when developing IoT systems. The results suggested that the integration of heterogeneous software components resulted one of the most painful issues, mainly due to the lack of documentation understandable by inexperienced developers, from both conceptual and technical perspectives. In fact, novice programmers devote a significant effort looking for documentation and code samples willing to understand them conceptually, or in the worst case, at least to make them work. Driven by the research question: \"How do the lessons learned by IoT novice programmers can be captured, so they become an asset for other novice developers?\", in this paper, we introduce Code Recipes. They consist of summarized and well-defined documentation modules, independent from programming languages or run-time environments, by which non-expert programmers can smoothly become familiar with source code, written by other developers that faced similar issues. Through a use case, we show how Code Recipes are a feasible mechanism to support novice IoT programmers in building their IoT systems",

Far from being just a bandwidth and latency improvement, the real potential of 5G lies in the intelligent management of network resources, and in the possibility of offering new services at the network level. Developers of IoT applications will no longer be forced to adopt a cloud-centric approach, where all storage and computation is centralized, but will be able to exploit network-provided resources, adopting Edge or Fog computing approaches, with numerous advantages such as higher locality, increased computation power and reliability, reduced latency and power consumption. Network operators, on the other hand, need to offer a compelling set of services while designing the intelligent components of their 5G networks, which would drive IoT developers to prefer their network-hosted services to cloud-based ones managed by over-the-top players. This paper aims at identifying which sets of services may be offered by a 5G network, by analyzing the computing, storage, and communication services that are currently offered by 11 major IoT platform providers, as well as those that are currently not being provided due to limitations of the cloud computing paradigm.",

This paper presents a learning environment to improve the experience of the lab sessions participants, both the students and the teaching assistants.

The application designed to support the learning environment stores all the events occurring during a SQL practice lab, i.e., task progression, query submissions, error feedback, assistance requests and interventions, and it provides information useful both for use on-the-fly and for later analysis. Thanks to the analysis of these data, the application dynamically provides teaching assistants with a graphical interface highlighting where assistance is most needed, by considering different factors such as the progression rate, the percentage of correct solutions, and the difficulties in solving the current exercise. Furthermore, the stored data allow teachers later on to analyze and to interpret the behavior of the students during the lab, and to have insights on their main mistakes and misconceptions. After describing the environment, the interfaces, and the approaches used to identify the students� teams that need timely assistance, the paper presents the results of different analyses performed using the collected data, to help the teacher better understand students� educational needs.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "During the last decade, network providers are faced by a growing problem regarding the distribution of bandwidth and computing resources. Recently, the mobile edge computing paradigm was proposed as a possible solution, mainly in consideration of the provided possibility of transferring service demands at the edge of the network. This solution heavily relies on the dynamic allocation of resources, depending on the user needs and network connection, therefore it becomes essential to correctly predict user movements and activities. This paper proposes an unsupervised methodology to define meaningful user locations from noninvasive user information, captured by the user terminal with no computing or battery overhead. The data is analyzed through a conjoined clustering algorithm to build a stochastic Markov chain to predict the users� movements and their bandwidth demands. Such a model could be used by network operators to optimize network resources allocation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we tested it on one of the largest public community�s labeled mobile and sensor dataset, developed by the �CrowdSignals.io� initiative, and we present positive and promising results concerning the prediction capabilities of the model.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "With the increase of connected devices and online services, and recently IoT devices, the number of notifications received by every person is growing. The importance of notifications, as they become part of people�s lives, often depends on various factors that can differently influence the reaction and the disruption of recipients. For this reason, the generation and the distribution of notifications has been gaining importance in the design of new applications, services, and smart devices. Nowadays, developers have not yet fully exploited all the advantages that the availability of multiple devices could bring in the customization and the distribution of notifications, e.g., exploiting a cross-device approach.\r\nThis paper presents XDN (Cross Device Notification), a framework to assist developers in creating cross-device notifications by scripting. The XDN architecture includes: a library to enable developers to design personalized notifications to be distributed among ad-hoc networks of IoT/mobile devices; a GUI to assist developers in implementing and testing (through a simulator) notification strategies; a server-side runtime environment; and an XDN IoT/mobile library for device support. We discuss the requirements for cross device notification systems, and we present the features of the XDN framework, in particular from the point of view of developer advantages, validated through different scenarios.",

			"typeID": 1,
			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Various programming environments for End-User Development (EUD) allow the composition of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, i.e., connections between IoT objects to personalize their joint behavior. These environments, however, only support a one-to-one mapping between pairs of object instances, and adopt a low level of abstraction that forces users to be aware of every single technology they may encounter in their applications. As a consequence, numerous open questions remain: would a �higher level� of abstraction help users creating their IoT applications more effectively and efficiently compared with the contemporary low-level representation? Which representation would users prefer? How high-level IoT applications could be actually executed? To answer these questions, we introduce EUPont, a high-level semantic model for EUD in the IoT. EUPont allows the creation of high-level IoT applications, able to adapt to different contextual situations. By integrating the ontology in the architecture of an EUD platform, we demonstrate how the semantic capabilities of the model allow the execution of high-level IoT applications. Furthermore, we evaluate the approach in a user study with 30 participants, by comparing a web interface for composing IoT applications powered by EUPont with the one employed by a widely used EUD platform. Results show that the high-level approach is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly than contemporary solutions.",

Many different mobile apps for breaking \"smartphone addiction\" and achieving \"digital wellbeing\" are available. However, it is still not clear whether and how such solutions work. Which functionality do they have? Are they effective and appreciated? Do they have a relevant impact on users' behavior? To answer these questions, (i) we reviewed the features of 42 digital wellbeing apps, (ii) we performed a thematic analysis on 1,128 user reviews of such apps, and (iii) we conducted a 3-week-long in-the-wild study of Socialize, an app that includes the most common digital wellbeing features, with 38 participants. We discovered that digital wellbeing apps are appreciated and useful for some specific situations. However, they do not promote the formation of new habits and they are perceived as not restrictive enough, thus not effectively helping users to change their behavior with smartphones.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "End users can program trigger-action rules to personalize the joint behavior of their smart devices and online services. Trigger-action programming is, however, a complex task for non-programmers and errors made during the composition of rules may lead to unpredictable behaviors and security issues, e.g., a lamp that is continuously fashing or a door that is unexpectedly unlocked. In this paper, we introduce EUDebug, a system that enables end users to debug trigger-action rules. With EUDebug, users compose rules in a web-based application like IFTTT. EUDebug highlights possible problems that the set of all defned rules may generate and allows their step-by-step simulation. Under the hood, a hybrid Semantic Colored Petri Net (SCPN) models, checks, and simulates trigger-action rules and their interactions. An exploratory study on 15 end users shows that EUDebug helps identifying and understanding problems in trigger-action rules, which are not easily discoverable in existing platforms.",

			"abstract": "Internet of Things systems are complex to develop. They are required to exhibit various features and run across several environments. Software developers have to deal with this heterogeneity both when configuring the development and execution environments and when writing the code. Meanwhile, computational notebooks have been gaining prominence due to their capability to consolidate text, executable code, and visualizations in a single document. Although they are mainly used in the field of data science, the characteristics of such notebooks could make them suitable to support the development of IoT systems as well. This work proposes an IoT-tailored literate computing approach in the form of a computational notebook. We present a use case of a typical IoT system involving several interconnected components and describe the implementation of a computational notebook as a tool to support its development. Finally, we point out the opportunities and limitations of this approach.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Nowadays, several interfaces for End-User Development (EUD) empower end users to jointly program the behavior of their smart devices and online services, typically through trigger-action rules. Despite their popularity, such interfaces often expose too much functionality, and force user to search among a large number of supported technologies disposed in confused grid menus. This paper contributes to the EUD with the aim of interactively assisting end users in composing IF-THEN rules with an optimizer in the loop. The goal, in particular, is to automatically redesign the layout of EUD interfaces to facilitate users in defining triggers and actions. For this purpose, a) we define a predictive model to characterize the composition of trigger-action rules on the basis of their final functionality; b) we adapt different optimization algorithms to explore the design space; and c) we present EUDoptimizer, the integration of our approach in IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD interfaces.We demonstrate that good layout solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, an empirical evaluation with 12 end users show evidence that EUDoptimizer reduces the efforts needed to compose trigger-action rules.",

			"abstract": "Semantic technologies and Linked Data are increasingly adopted as core application modules, in many knowledge domains and involving various stakeholders: ontology engineers, software architects, doctors, employees, etc. Such a diffusion calls for better access to models and data, which should be direct, mobile, visual and time effective. While a relevant core of research efforts investigated the problem of ontology visualization, discovering different paradigms, layouts, and interaction modalities, a few approaches target mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. \r\nTouch interaction, indeed, has the potential of dramatically improving usability of Linked Data and of semantic-based solutions in real-world applications and mash-ups, by enabling direct and tactile interactions with involved knowledge objects. \r\nIn this paper, we move a step towards touch-based, mobile interfaces for semantic models by presenting an ontology browsing platform for Android devices. We exploit state of the art touch-based interaction paradigms, e.g., pie menus, pinch-to-zoom, etc., to empower effective ontology browsing. Our research mainly focuses on interactions, yet providing support to different visualization approaches thanks to a clear decoupling between model-level operation and visual representations.\r\nPresented results include the design and implementation of a working prototype application, as well as a first validation involving habitual users of semantic technologies. Results show a low learning curve and positive reactions to the proposed paradigms, which are perceived as both innovative and useful.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "End users can nowadays define applications in the format of IF-THEN rules to personalize their IoT devices and online services. Along with the possibility to compose such applications, however, comes the need to debug them, e.g., to avoid unpredictable and dangerous behaviors. In this context, different questions are still unexplored: which visual languages are more appropriate for debugging IF-THEN rules? Which information do end users need to understand, identify, and correct errors? To answer these questions, we first conducted a literature analysis by reviewing previous works on end-user debugging, with the aim of extracting design guidelines. Then, we developed My IoT Puzzle, a tool to compose and debug IF-THEN rules based on the Jigsaw metaphor. My IoT Puzzle interactively assists users in the debugging process with different real-time feedback, and it allows the resolution of conflicts by providing textual and graphical explanations. An exploratory study with 6 participants preliminary confirms the effectiveness of our approach, showing that the usage of the Jigsaw metaphor, along with real-time feedback and explanations, helps users understand and fix conflicts among IF-THEN rules.",

In this workshop, we will explore the concept of care networks, which can better account for the numerous human and non-human actors and roles that compose care. We invite designers, researchers, and practitioners to participate in a full-day workshop in which we will reflect on empirical studies and theoretical accounts of care networks, and put forward an agenda for better acknowledging care networks in the research around healthcare technologies and systems.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "The spread of voice-driven devices has a positive impact for people with disabilities in smart environments, since such devices allow them to perform a series of daily activities that were difficult or impossible before. As a result, their quality of life and autonomy increase. However, the speech recognition technology employed in such devices becomes limited with people having communication disorders, like dysarthria. People with dysarthria may be unable to control their smart environments, at least with the needed proficiency; this problem may negatively affect the perceived reliability of the entire environment.\r\nBy exploiting the TORGO database of speech samples pronounced by people with dysarthria, this paper compares the accuracy of the dysarthric speech recognition as achieved by three speech recognition cloud platforms, namely IBM Watson Speech-to- Text, Google Cloud Speech, and Microsoft Azure Bing Speech. Such services, indeed, are used in many virtual assistants deployed in smart environments, such as Google Home. The goal is to investigate whether such cloud platforms are usable to recognize dysarthric speech, and to understand which of them is the most suitable for people with dysarthria.\r\nResults suggest that the three platforms have comparable performance in recognizing dysarthric speech, and that the accuracy of the recognition is related to the speech intelligibility of the person. Overall, the platforms are limited when the dysarthric speech intelligibility is low (80-90% of word error rate), while they improve up to reach a word error rate of 15-25% for people without abnormality in their speech intelligibility.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Nowadays, end users can personalize their smart devices and web applications by defining or reusing IF-THEN rules through dedicated End-User Development (EUD) tools. Despite apparent simplicity, such tools present their own set of issues. The emerging and increasing complexity of the Internet of Things, for example, is barely taken into account, and the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions of different smart devices and web applications is continuously growing. Such a large design space makes end-user personalization a complex task for non-programmers, and motivates the need of assisting users in easily discovering and managing rules and functionality, e.g., through recommendation techniques. In this paper, we tackle the emerging problem of recommending IF-THEN rules to end users by presenting RecRules, a hybrid and semantic recommendation system. Through a mixed content and collaborative approach, the goal of RecRules is to recommend by functionality: it suggests rules based on their final purposes, thus overcoming details like manufacturers and brands. The algorithm uses a semantic reasoning process to enrich rules with semantic information, with the aim of uncovering hidden connections between rules in terms of shared functionality. Then, it builds a collaborative semantic graph, and it exploits different types of path-based features to train a learning to rank algorithm and compute top-N recommendations. We evaluate RecRules through different experiments on real user data extracted from IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD tool. Results are promising: they show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms, and open the way for a new class of recommender systems for EUD that take into account the actual functionality needed by end users.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "Smartphones have the potential to produce new habits, i.e., habitual phone usage sessions consistently associated with explicit contextual cues. Despite there is evidence that habitual smartphone use is perceived as meaningless and addictive, little is known about what such habits are, how they can be detected, and how their disruptive effect can be mitigated. In this paper, we propose a data analytic methodology based on association rule mining to automatically discover smartphone habits from smartphone usage data. By assessing the methodology with more than 130,000 smartphone sessions collected in-the-wild, we show evidence that smartphone use can be characterized by different types of complex habits, which are highly diversified across users and involve multiple apps. To promote discussion and present our future work, we introduce a mobile app that exploits the proposed methodology to assist users in monitoring and changing their smartphone habits through implementation intentions, i.e., \"if-then\" plans where if's are contextual cues and then's are goal-related behaviors.",

			"abstract": "Core War is a game where two or more programs, called warriors, are executed in the same memory area by a time-sharing processor. The final goal of each warrior is to crash the others by overwriting them with illegal instructions. The game was popularized by A. K. Dewdney in his Scientific American column in the mid-1980s. In order to automatically devise strong warriors, MicroGP, a test program generation algorithm, was extended with the ability to assimilate existing code and to detect clones; furthermore, a new selection mechanism for promoting diversity independent from fitness calculations was added. The evolved warriors are the first machine-written programs ever able to become King of the Hill (champion) in all four main international Tiny Hills. This paper shows how playing Core War may help generate effective test programs for validation and test of microprocessors. Tackling a more mundane problem, the described techniques are currently being exploited for the automatic completion and refinement of existing test programs. Preliminary experimental results are reported.",

However, in the new design flow, validation still remains a challenge: while new technologies based on formal verification are only marginally accepted, standard techniques based on simulation are beginning to fall behind the increased circuit complexity. This paper proposes a new approach to simulation-based validation, in which a genetic algorithm helps the designer in generating useful input sequences to be included in the test bench. The technique has been applied to an industrial circuit, showing that the quality of the validation process is increased.",

			"abstract": "Searching the Web proved to be a critical task in which both user satisfaction and speed requirements must be satisfied. Nowadays search engines provide amazing capabilities of searching resources on the Web though they are still based on text indexing and seldom exploit semantics of resource content. Therefore they sometimes fail on the identification of query context, providing results that are not relevant with respect to user needs; this is especially true for nontrained users. The semantic Web specifically addresses such an issue by providing means to define resources and query semantics using ontologies and semantic annotations. We propose a concept-based search paradigm for document retrieval. We define a new representation of the involved information space, introducing the notion of conceptual spectrum to identify the global topic landscape of Web resources and queries. We exploit such a representation to design and implement a prototypical version of a concept-based search engine. We compare the proposed approach to a traditional keyword-based engine, on a specific domain. Results are promising and show the approach feasibility.",

However, test-related activities are lacking behind this trend, mainly since effective fault models and test signals generators are still missing. This paper proposes ARPIA, a new simulation-based evolutionary test generator. ARPIA adopts an innovative high-level fault model that enables efficient fault simulation and guarantees good correlation with gate-level results. The approach exploits an evolutionary algorithm to drive the search of effective patterns within the gigantic space of all possible signal sequences. ARPIA operates on register-transfer level VHDL descriptions and generates effective test patterns. Experimental results show that the achieved results are comparable or better than those obtained by high-level similar approaches or even by gate-level ones.",

This paper propose an evolutionary approach for minimizing the application time of a test set by opportunely extending it and exploiting a new hardware architecture, named interleaved scan. The peculiarities of the problem suggest the use of a slightly modified genetic algorithm with concurrent populations.

The proposed technique relies on coupling a Genetic Algorithm with a simulator of the system under verification, and is especially suited for verifying performance-related aspects. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to the quantitative verification of a network protocol: the TCP protocol operating on a given network.

Genetic algorithms recently proved themselves excellent tools for giving good, yet approximate, solution to hard-to-solve problems.

The possibility to validate protocol interfaces is extremely useful in many industrial design flows and the proposed methodology does not impose particular requirements and it is able to fit in existing design flows: the proposed approach is based on coupling a commercial simulator with a genetic algorithm that tries to disprove the equivalence of an implementation with its high-level prototype. The use of a commercial simulator guarantees a complete compatibility with current standards and the method is able to fit painlessly in an existing industrial flow. Moreover, the use of a genetic algorithm allows the analysis of large and realistic designs. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effectively able to deal with realistic designs, discovering potential problems, and, although approximate in nature, it is able to provide a high degree of confidence in the results.",

The goal of this paper is to propose an automatic input pattern generation tool able to assist designers in the generation of a test bench for difficult parts of small- or medium- sized digital protocol interfaces. The proposed approach exploit a Genetic Algorithm connected to a commercial simulator for cultivating a set of input sequence able to execute given statements in the interface description. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the new ITC�99 benchmark set, a collection of circuits offering a wide spectrum of complexity. Experimental results show that some portions of the circuits remained uncovered, and the subsequent manual analysis allowed identifying design redundancies.",

Testing is a key issue in the design and production of digital circuits and the adoption of Built-In Self-Test (BIST) techniques is increasingly popular. In this paper, the Selfish Gene algorithm is adopted for determining the logic for a BIST architecture based on Cellular Automata (CA). A Genetic Algorithm has already been proposed for identifying good BIST architectures based on CA. However, by adopting 2-bit cells, such a method introduced a significant area overhead. Thanks to the adoption of the new and more powerful search engine, we were able to identify simpler BIST structures with a lower area overhead, but still able to obtain the same fault coverage.",

			"abstract": "C2BIST (Circular CA BlST) is a Built-In Self Test (BIST) architecture for sequential circuits based on Cellular Automata (CA). When CA cells implement suitable rules, this structure shows good test generation capabilities, reaching high fault coverage. The main characteristic of this approach is that the same CA is used for both generation and compaction, leading to a trade-off between attained fault coverage and area overhead more favorable than other BIST approaches. On the other hand, the main problem is that the circuit, during the test phase, may enter a loop early, reducing the attained fault coverage. The paper analyzes this problem and proposes a solution based on the partial reset technique, that is able to break cycles by exploiting the circuit flip-flops synchronous reset signal with a small area overhead with respect to the basic C2BIST architecture. Experimental results allow a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach.",

A new Domotic OSGi Gateway (DOG) is presented, able to manage different domotic networks as a single, technology neutral, home automation system. The adoption of a standard framework such as OSGi, and of sophisticated modeling techniques stemming from the Semantic Web research community, allows DOG to go beyond simple automation and to support reasoning-based intelligence inside home environments. By exploiting automatic device generalization, syntactic and semantic command validation, and internetwork scenario definition, DOG provides the building blocks for supporting the evolution of current, isolated, home automation plants into IDEs, where heterogeneous devices and domotic systems are coordinated to behave as a single, intelligent, proactive system. The paper introduces the DOG architecture and the underlying ontology modeling. A case study is also illustrated, where DOG controls a laboratory reconstruction of a simple domotic environment.",

While there are many available approaches to enable interoperation with domotic systems as a whole, few solutions tackle interoperation between single domotic devices belonging to different technology networks. This paper introduces an automatic device-to-device interoperation solution exploiting ontology- based semantic device modeling. By explicitly modeling interoperation through ontology concepts and relations, the devised solution allows to automatically generate devicelevel interoperation rules. These rules, executed by a suitable rule-execution layer integrated in an intelligent domotic gateway (DOG), allow interconnecting arbitrary devices in a general and scalable manner. A case study is shown, where the automatic-generation of interoperation rules is applied to two real-world demo cases, with either KNX or BTicino devices.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "In the last years Home Automation systems gained new momentum, permeating many human-related environments, from homes to hospitals. The rapid evolution of such systems showed several interoperability pitfalls and a generally insufficient support for advanced user�home interaction. To tackle these emerging issues, recent research works defined the concept of Intelligent Domotic Environments (IDEs) where different automation systems, appliances and devices are integrated into a single powerful environment, capable of providing Ambient Intelligence (AmI) functionalities. IDEs represent one of the first attempts to define a framework for AmI environments based on off-the-shelf domotic systems. This paper contributes to extend IDE capabilities by supporting basic intelligence requirements through a rule-based reasoning mechanism. Starting from a formal model of IDE elements (DogOnt), rules are defined to evaluate environment properties. Property checking is done both off-line, for structural properties, i.e., properties involving the physical structure and configuration of the IDE, and on-line for properties dependent on current IDE states. Two rule languages, SWRL and JenaRules, are considered for rule formalization and their reasoning performance is evaluated by comparing two different rule engines, namely Jess and Jena. Results show that rule-based reasoning can deal with quite complex property checking, effectively addressing basic intelligence for IDEs and providing the basis for more advanced behaviors such as user adaptation and proactive interaction.",

In applicazioni critiche, quali il controllo del traffico aereo, di reattori nucleari, di sistemi di telecomunicazioni, di apparecchiature mediche, un guasto al sistema informatico pu?= costare la vita di persone o ingenti perdite economiche. I sistemi informatici impiegati in questo tipo di applicazioni sono solitamente progettati in modo da tollerare i guasti che possono causare gravi malfunzionamenti. Risulta allora necessario identificare metodologie di qualit? che permettano di accertare che un sistema critico per la sicurezza sia stato realizzato in modo corretto e che soddisfi i livelli di affidabilit? richiesti. Una valida soluzione al problema ? offerta dalla fault injection, ossia la deliberata iniezione di guasti all'interno di un sistema, allo scopo di analizzarne le reazioni. Nel primo capitolo di questo articolo viene affrontata l'analisi del problema dell'affidabilit? di un sistema (dependability) e viene descritto il contesto in cui si opera nell'analisi di sistemi \"affidabili\". Nel secondo capitolo vengono definiti i modelli di guasto e le differenze di tali modelli rispetto ad un approccio orientato al collaudo. Nel terzo capitolo sono descritte le principali tecniche di fault injection presentate in letteratura, evidenziando, per ognuna, l'idea di base, i pregi e i principali difetti.",

			"abstract": "Testing is a key issue in the design and production of digital circuits: the adoption of BIST (Built-In Self-Test) techniques is increasingly popular, but requires efficient algorithms for the generation of the logic which generates the test vectors applied to the Unit Under Test. This paper addresses the issue of identifying a Cellular Automaton able to generate input patterns to detect stuckat faults inside a Finite State Machine (FSM) circuit. Previous results already proposed a solution based on a Genetic Algorithm which directly identifies a Cellular Automaton able to reach good Fault Coverage of the stuck-at faults. However, such method requires 2-bit cells in the Cellular Automaton, thus resulting in a high area overhead. This paper presents a new solution, with an area occupation limited to 1 bit per cell; the improved results are possible due to the adoption of a new optimization algorithm, the Selfish Gene algorithm. Experimental results are provided, which show that in most of the standard benchmark circuits the Cellular Automaton selected by the Selfish Gene algorithm is able to reach a Fault Coverage higher that what can be obtained with current engineering practice with comparable area occupation.",

			"abstract": "Modern VLSI design methodologies and manufacturing technologies are making circuits increasingly fast. The quest for higher circuit performance and integration density stems from fields such as the telecommunication one where high speed and capability of dealing with large data sets is mandatory. The design of high-speed circuits is a challenging task, and can be carried out only if designers can exploit suitable CAD tools. Among the several aspects of high-speed circuit design, controlling power consumption is today a major issue for ensuring that circuits can operate at full speed without damages. In particular, tools for fast and accurate estimation of power consumption of highspeed circuits are required. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting the maximum power consumption of sequential circuits. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem, and solve it resorting to an evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, we empirically assess the effectiveness of our problem formulation with respect to the classical unconstrained formulation. Finally, we report experimental results assessing the effectiveness of the prototypical tool we implemented.",

			"abstract": "Ambient Intelligence (AmI) research is giving birth to a multitude of futuristic home scenarios and applications; however a clear discrepancy between current installations and research-level designs can be easily noticed. Whether this gap is due to the natural distance between research and engineered applications or to mismatching of needs and solutions remains to be understood. This paper discusses the results of a survey about user expectations with respect to intelligent homes. Starting from a very simple and open question about what users would ask to their intelligent homes, we derived user perceptions about what intelligent homes can do, and we analyzed to what extent current research solutions, as well as commercially available systems, address these emerging needs. Interestingly, most user concerns about smart homes involve comfort and household tasks and most of them can be currently addressed by existing commercial systems, or by suitable combinations of them.  A clear trend emerges from the poll findings: the technical gap between user expectations and current solutions is actually narrower and easier to bridge than it may appear, but users perceive this gap as wide and limiting, thus requiring the AmI community to establish a more effective communication with final users, with an increased attention to real-world deployment.",

			"abstract": "In the 21st century, all the major countries around the world are coming together to reduce the impact of energy generation and consumption on the global environment. Energy conservation and its efficient usage has become a top agenda on the desks of many governments. In the last decade, the drive to make homes automated and to deliver a better assisted living picked pace and the research into home automation systems accelerated, usually based on a centralized residential gateway. However most devised solutions fail to provide users with information about power consumption of different house appliances. The ability to collect power consumption information can lead us to have a more energy efficient society. The goal addressed in this paper is to enable residential gateways to provide the energy consumption information, in a machine understandable format, to support third party applications and services. To reach this goal, we propose a Semantic Energy Information  Publishing Framework. The proposed framework publishes, for different appliances in the  house, their power consumption information and other properties, in a machine understandable format. Appliance properties are exposed according to the existing semantic modeling supported by residential gateways, while instantaneous power consumption is modeled through a new modular Energy Profile ontology.",

However, especially for people with severe mobility impairments, there is still a lack of tools and interfaces for effective control and interaction with home automation systems, and general-purpose solutions are seldom applicable due to the complexity, asynchronicity, time dependent behavior, and safety concerns typical of the home environment. \r\nThis paper focuses on user-environment interfaces based on the eye tracking technology, which often is the only viable interaction modality for  users as such. We propose an eye-based interface tackling the specific requirements of smart environments, already outlined in a public Recommendation issued by the COGAIN European Network of Excellence. The proposed interface has been implemented as a software prototype based on the ETU universal driver, thus being potentially able  to run on a variety of eye trackers, and it is compatible with a wide set of smart home technologies, handled by the Domotic OSGi Gateway. A first interface evaluation, with user testing sessions, has been carried and results show that the interface is quite effective and usable without discomfort by people with almost regular eye movement control.",

			"abstract": "Ambient Intelligence and Smart Home Automation systems are currently emerging as feasible and ready to exploit solutions to support more intelligent features inside future and current homes. Thanks to increased availability of off-the-shelf components and to relatively easy to implement solutions we are experiencing a steady evolution of households, causing an ever-increasing users� awareness of the capabilities of such innovative environments. To foster effective adoption of Smart Home Automation technologies in our home environments, traditional architectural and plant design must be complemented by sound design methodologies and tools, supporting the whole environment design cycle, including for example modeling, simulation and emulation, as well as, when feasible, formal model-checking and verification. Several research efforts have already addressed the design of expressive modeling tools, mostly based on Semantic Web technologies, as well as of suitable platforms for adding interoperation and rule-based intelligence to home environments. This paper proposes a new modeling methodology designed to fit the different phases of Intelligent Environments design, with a particular focus on validation and verification of the whole system. Carefully designed separation of modeled entities permits to exploit the DoMAIns framework during all phases of the environment design, from early abstract conception to the final in-field deployment. The DoMAIns design methodology is applied to a sample use case that involves comprehensive modeling and simulation of a Bank Security Booth, including the environment, the control algorithms, the automation devices and the user. Results show that the approach is feasible and that can easily handle different types of environment modeling, required in the different design phases, and for each of them it may support simulation, emulation, or other verification techniques.",

Building and Home Automation have a potential to profoundly impact current and future buildings� energy ef?ciency by informing users about their current consumption patterns, by suggesting more ef?cient behaviors, and by pro-actively changing/modifying user actions for reducing the associated energy wastes. In this paper we investigate the capability of an automated home to automatically, and timely, inform users about energy consumption, by harvesting opinions of residential inhabitants on energy feedback interfaces. We report here the results of an on-line survey, involving nearly a thousand participants, about feedback mechanisms suggested by the research community, with the goal of understanding what feedback is felt by home inhabitants easier to understand, more likely to be used, and more effective in promoting behavior changes.  Contextually, we also collect and distill users� attitude towards in-home energy displays and their preferred locations, gathering useful insights on user-driven design of more effective in-home energy displays.",

An unobtrusive and typically wearable device, like a bracelet or a wrist watch, that lets users perform various operations in their homes and to receive notifications from the environment, could strenghten the interaction with such systems, in particular for those people not accustomed to computer systems (e.g., elderly) or in contexts where they are not in front of a screen. Moreover, such wearable devices reduce the technological gap introduced in the environment by home automation systems, thus permitting a higher level of acceptance in the daily activities and improving the interaction between the environment and its inhabitants.

Data not only needs to be cleaned, but it must also be filtered and aggregated to relieve higher level algorithms from near real-time handling of such massive data flows. We propose here a stream-processing framework (spChains), based upon state-of-the-art stream processing engines, which enables declarative and modular composition of stream processing chains built atop of a set of extensible stream processing blocks. While stream processing blocks are delivered as a standard, yet extensible,  library of application-independent processing elements, chains can be defined by the pervasive application engineering team. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the spChains framework on two real-world applications in the energy management and in the industrial plant management domains, by evaluating them on a prototype implementation based on the Esper stream processor.",

			"abstract": "Testing is a key issue in the design and production of digital circuits: the adoption of BIST (Built-in Self-Test) techniques is increasingly popular, but sometimes requires efficient algorithms for the automatic generation of the logic which generates the test vectors applied to the unit under test. This paper addresses the issue of identifying a cellular automaton able to generate input patterns to detect stuck-at faults inside a finite state machine (FSM). A suitable hardware structure is first identified. A genetic algorithm is then proposed, which directly identifies a cellular automaton able to reach a very good fault coverage of the stuck-at faults. The novelty of the method consists in combining the generation of test patterns with the synthesis of a cellular automaton able to reproduce them. Experimental results are provided, which show that in most of the standard benchmark circuits the cellular automaton selected by the genetic algorithm is able to reach a fault coverage close to the maximum one. Our approach is the first attempt of exploiting evolutionary techniques for identifying the hardware for input pattern generation in BIST structures.",

The problem can be tackled both from the point of view of the utility provider, with the intelligence embedded in the smart grid, or from the point of view of the consumer, thanks to suitable local energy management systems (EMS). Conserving energy, however, should respect the user requirements regarding the desired state of the environment, therefore an EMS should constantly and intelligently find the balance between user requirements and energy saving. The paper proposes a solution to this problem, based on explicit high-level modeling of user intentions and automatic control of device states through the solution and optimization of a constrained Boolean satisfiability problem. The proposed approach has been integrated into a smart environment framework, and promising preliminary results are reported.",

This paper attempts to consider correctness, reliability, safety and security in the design process of SmE and its related components by proposing a design time modeling and formal verification methodology. The proposed methodology covers various design features related to modeling and formal verification SmE (focusing on users, devices, environment, control algorithms and their interaction) against the set of the requirements through model checking.

The presence of these diverse smart devices has raised a major problem of managing environments. A rising solution to the problem is the modeling of user goals and intentions, and then interacting with the environments using user defined goals. `Domotic Effects' is a user goal modeling framework, which provides Ambient Intelligence (AmI) designers and integrators with an abstract layer that enables the definition of generic goals in a smart environment, in a declarative way, which can be used to design and develop intelligent applications. The high-level nature of domotic effects also allows the residents to program their personal space as they see fit: they can define different achievement criteria for a particular generic goal, e.g., by defining a combination of devices having some particular states, by using domain-specific custom operators. This paper describes an approach for the automatic enforcement of domotic effects in case of the Boolean application domain, suitable for intelligent monitoring and control in domotic environments. Effect enforcement is the ability to determine device configurations that can achieve a set of generic goals (domotic effects). The paper also presents an architecture to implement the enforcement of Boolean domotic effects, and results obtained from carried out experiments prove the feasibility of the proposed approach and highlight the responsiveness of the implemented effect enforcement architecture.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Smart environments (SmE) are richly integrated with multiple heterogeneous devices; they perform the operations in intelligent manner by considering the context and actions/behaviors of the users. Their major objective is to enable the environment to provide ease and comfort to the users. The reliance on these systems demands consistent behavior. The versatility of devices, user behavior and intricacy of communication complicate the modeling and verification of SmE�s reliable behavior. Of the many available modeling and verification techniques, formal methods appear to be the most promising. Due to a large variety of implementation scenarios and support for conditional behavior/processing, the concept of SmE is applicable to diverse areas which calls for focused research. As a result, a number of modeling and verification techniques have been made available for designers. This paper explores and puts into perspective the modeling and verification techniques based on an extended literature survey. These techniques mainly focus on some specific aspects, with a few overlapping scenarios (such as user interaction, devices interaction and control, context awareness, etc.), which were of the interest to the researchers based on their specialized competencies. The techniques are categorized on the basis of various factors and formalisms considered for the modeling and verification and later analyzed. The results show that no surveyed technique maintains a holistic perspective; each technique is used for the modeling and verification of specific SmE aspects. The results further help the designers select appropriate modeling and verification techniques under given requirements and stress for more R&D effort into SmE modeling and verification research.",

			"abstract": "Smart Environment is one of several domains in which Semantic Web technologies are applied nowadays. Ontologies, \nin particular, are used as core modeling languages for representing devices, systems and environments. Developing such ontologies, \nthat typically involve several device descriptions (individuals) and related information, i.e., individuals of classes contributing to the device model, is often done by a \nmanual, time consuming, and error-prone approach. Flexible and semi-automatic tools \nare therefore needed to enhance ontology population and to enable end-users to fruitfully configure \ntheir Smart Environments without the intervention of an ontology expert.\n\nThis paper presents a template based approach, which increases accuracy, ease of use, and time-effectiveness of the ontology population process by reducing the amount of user-given information of about an order of magnitude, with respect to the fully manual approach. User-required information only pertains device features (e.g., name, location, etc.) and never implies knowledge of Semantic Web technologies, thus enabling end-user configuration of smart homes and buildings. Experimental results with a prototypical implementation confirm the viability of the approach on a real-world use case.",

			"abstract": "Abstract Modern Smart Environments (SmE) are equipped with a multitude of devices and sensors aimed at intelligent services. The variety of devices has raised a major problem of managing SmE. An increasingly adopted solution to the problem is the modeling of goals and intentions, and then using artificial intelligence to control the respective SmE accordingly. Generally, the solution advocates that the goals can be achieved by controlling the evolution of the states of the devices. In order to automatically reach a particular state, a sophisticated solution is required through which the respective commands, notifications and their correct sequence can be discovered and enforced on the real devices. In this paper, a comprehensive methodology is proposed by considering a ) the composite nature of the state of an individual device; b ) the possible variation of specific commands, notifications and their sequence based on the current states of the devices. The methodology works at two levels: design-time and runtime. At design-time, it constructs the extended data and control flow behavioral graphs of the devices by using the concepts of a model checking approach. Then, at runtime, it uses these graphs for finding the reliable evolution through which the desired goal can be fulfilled. The proposed methodology is implemented over the Domotic Effects framework and a home automation system, i.e. Domotic OSGi Gateway (Dog). The implementation and experimentation details indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "The design of smart homes, buildings and environments currently suffers from a low maturity of available methodologies and tools. Technologies, devices and protocols strongly bias the design process towards vertical integration, and more flexible solutions based on separation of design concerns are seldom applied. As a result, the current landscape of smart environments is mostly populated by defectively designed solutions where application requirements (e.g., end-user functionality) are too often mixed and intertwined with technical requirements (e.g., managing the network of devices). A mature and effective design process must, instead, rely on a clear separation between the application layer and the underlying enabling technologies, to enable effective design reuse. The role of smart gateways is to enable this separation of concerns and to provide an abstracted view of available automation technology to higher software layers.\nThis paper presents a blueprint for the information technology (IT) architecture of smart buildings that builds on top of established software engineering practices, such as model-driven development and semantic representation, and that avoids many pitfalls inherent in legacy approaches. The paper will also present a representative use case where the approach has been applied and the corresponding modeling and software tools.",

			"abstract": "Due to the increasing spread of location-aware applications, developers interest in user location estimation has grown in recent years. As users spend the majority of their time in few meaningful places (i.e., groups of near locations that can be considered as a unique place, such as home, school or the workplace), this paper presents a new energy efficient method to estimate user presence in a meaningful place. Specifically, instead of using commonly used but energy hungry methods such as GPS and network positioning techniques, the proposed method applies a Machine Learning algorithm based on Decision Trees, to predict the user presence in a meaningful place by collecting and analyzing: a) user activity, b) information from received notifications (receipt time, generating service, sender-receiver relationship), and c) device status (battery level and ringtone mode). The results demonstrate that, using 20 days of training data and testing the system with data coming from 14 persons, the accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) is 89.40% (standard deviation: 8.27%) with a precision of 89.04% and a recall of 89.40%. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the importance of each considered feature, by comparing the prediction accuracy obtained with different combinations of features.",

			"abstract": "Programming environments for end-user personalization in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly common. They allow users to define simple IoT applications, i.e., connections between different IoT devices and services. Unfortunately, the adopted representation models are highly technology-dependent, e.g., they often categorize devices and services by manufacturer or brand. Such an approach is not suitable to face the expected growth of the IoT, nor it allows to adapt to yet undiscovered IoT services. In this paper, we present a generic and technology-independent representation for IoT end-user programming environments. The aim of this \"high-level\" representation is to allow end-users to create abstract IoT applications that adapt to different contextual situations. We preliminary evaluated the representation by comparing it with the one used by existing programming environments in a user study with 10 participants. Results show that the representation is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Video games are not just played for fun; they have become a handy instrument for the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. However, several barriers prevent many children with disabilities from playing action-oriented video games, alone or with their peers. In particular, children with severe motor disabilities, who rely on one-switch interaction for accessing electronic devices, find fast-paced games that require rapid decision-making and timely responses, completely unplayable. This article contributes to lowering such barriers by presenting GNomon (Gaming NOMON), a software framework based on the NOMON mode of interaction that allows the creation of action-oriented single-switch video games. The article reports the results of two studies that evaluate the playability and rehabilitation suitability of GNomon-based video games. The playability of GNomon-based games is evaluated by assessing their learnability, effectiveness, errors, satisfaction, memorability, and enjoyability with a group of eight children with severe motor disabilities. The suitability for pediatric rehabilitation is determined by means of a focus group with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists, and psychologists from a Local Health Agency in Turin, Italy. The results of the playability study are positive: All children had fun playing GNomon-based video games, and seven of eight were able to interact and play autonomously. The results of the rehabilitation-suitability study also entail that GNomon-based games can be exploited in training hand-eye coordination and maintenance of selective attention over time. The article finally offers critical hindsight and reflections and shows possible new future game concepts.",

To overcome these issues, we present AwareNotifications, an intelligent system based on user-defined preferences to manage multi-device notifications. AwareNotifications is powered by Semantic Web technologies. By directly exploiting user preferences in the semantic reasoning process, the system is able to identify suitable device(s), modality, and moment(s) to deliver the incoming user notifications. We evaluated AwareNotifications in a user study with 15 participants, in which we compared our system with the \"traditional\" notification delivery system. The study confirms the perceived effectiveness of AwareNotifications, and provides insights to further improve the system.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and programming languages make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. Perforce, Software Engineering challenges are even more difficult to address by novice programmers. Previous research focused on identifying the most challenging issues that novice programmers experience when developing IoT systems. The results suggested that the integration of heterogeneous software components resulted one of the most painful issues, mainly due to the lack of documentation understandable by inexperienced developers, from both conceptual and technical perspectives. In fact, novice programmers devote a significant effort looking for documentation and code samples willing to understand them conceptually, or in the worst case, at least to make them work. Driven by the research question: \"How do the lessons learned by IoT novice programmers can be captured, so they become an asset for other novice developers?\", in this paper, we introduce Code Recipes. They consist of summarized and well-defined documentation modules, independent from programming languages or run-time environments, by which non-expert programmers can smoothly become familiar with source code, written by other developers that faced similar issues. Through a use case, we show how Code Recipes are a feasible mechanism to support novice IoT programmers in building their IoT systems",

However, a consequence of these devices embracing voice control is that people with dysarthria or other speech impairments may be unable to control their intelligent environments, at least with proficiency. This paper investigates to which extent people with dysarthria can use and be understood by the three most common virtual assistants, namely Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa. Starting from the sentences in the TORGO database of dysarthric articulation, the differences between such assistants are investigated and discussed. Preliminary results show that the three virtual assistants have comparable performance, with an accuracy of the recognition in the range of 50-60%.",

			"abstract": "The advent of the 5G network is a key enabler to the growth of IoT, with the promise to innovate and revolutionize contemporary architectures by enabling new IoT-optimized services. Far from being just a bandwidth and latency improvement, the real potential of 5G lies in the intelligent management of network resources, and in the possibility of offering new services at the network level. Developers of IoT applications will no longer be forced to adopt a cloud-centric approach, where all storage and computation is centralized, but will be able to exploit network-provided resources, adopting Edge or Fog computing approaches, with numerous advantages such as higher locality, increased computation power and reliability, reduced latency and power consumption. Network operators, on the other hand, need to offer a compelling set of services while designing the intelligent components of their 5G networks, which would drive IoT developers to prefer their network-hosted services to cloud-based ones managed by over-the-top players. This paper aims at identifying which sets of services may be offered by a 5G network, by analyzing the computing, storage, and communication services that are currently offered by 11 major IoT platform providers, as well as those that are currently not being provided due to limitations of the cloud computing paradigm.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "During the last decade, network providers are faced by a growing problem regarding the distribution of bandwidth and computing resources. Recently, the mobile edge computing paradigm was proposed as a possible solution, mainly in consideration of the provided possibility of transferring service demands at the edge of the network. This solution heavily relies on the dynamic allocation of resources, depending on the user needs and network connection, therefore it becomes essential to correctly predict user movements and activities. This paper proposes an unsupervised methodology to define meaningful user locations from noninvasive user information, captured by the user terminal with no computing or battery overhead. The data is analyzed through a conjoined clustering algorithm to build a stochastic Markov chain to predict the users� movements and their bandwidth demands. Such a model could be used by network operators to optimize network resources allocation. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we tested it on one of the largest public community�s labeled mobile and sensor dataset, developed by the �CrowdSignals.io� initiative, and we present positive and promising results concerning the prediction capabilities of the model.",

			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Various programming environments for End-User Development (EUD) allow the composition of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, i.e., connections between IoT objects to personalize their joint behavior. These environments, however, only support a one-to-one mapping between pairs of object instances, and adopt a low level of abstraction that forces users to be aware of every single technology they may encounter in their applications. As a consequence, numerous open questions remain: would a �higher level� of abstraction help users creating their IoT applications more effectively and efficiently compared with the contemporary low-level representation? Which representation would users prefer? How high-level IoT applications could be actually executed? To answer these questions, we introduce EUPont, a high-level semantic model for EUD in the IoT. EUPont allows the creation of high-level IoT applications, able to adapt to different contextual situations. By integrating the ontology in the architecture of an EUD platform, we demonstrate how the semantic capabilities of the model allow the execution of high-level IoT applications. Furthermore, we evaluate the approach in a user study with 30 participants, by comparing a web interface for composing IoT applications powered by EUPont with the one employed by a widely used EUD platform. Results show that the high-level approach is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly than contemporary solutions.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "End users can program trigger-action rules to personalize the joint behavior of their smart devices and online services. Trigger-action programming is, however, a complex task for non-programmers and errors made during the composition of rules may lead to unpredictable behaviors and security issues, e.g., a lamp that is continuously fashing or a door that is unexpectedly unlocked. In this paper, we introduce EUDebug, a system that enables end users to debug trigger-action rules. With EUDebug, users compose rules in a web-based application like IFTTT. EUDebug highlights possible problems that the set of all defned rules may generate and allows their step-by-step simulation. Under the hood, a hybrid Semantic Colored Petri Net (SCPN) models, checks, and simulates trigger-action rules and their interactions. An exploratory study on 15 end users shows that EUDebug helps identifying and understanding problems in trigger-action rules, which are not easily discoverable in existing platforms.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "Internet of Things systems are complex to develop. They are required to exhibit various features and run across several environments. Software developers have to deal with this heterogeneity both when configuring the development and execution environments and when writing the code. Meanwhile, computational notebooks have been gaining prominence due to their capability to consolidate text, executable code, and visualizations in a single document. Although they are mainly used in the field of data science, the characteristics of such notebooks could make them suitable to support the development of IoT systems as well. This work proposes an IoT-tailored literate computing approach in the form of a computational notebook. We present a use case of a typical IoT system involving several interconnected components and describe the implementation of a computational notebook as a tool to support its development. Finally, we point out the opportunities and limitations of this approach.",

			"title": "EUDoptimizer: Assisting End Users in Composing IF-THEN Rules Through Optimization",
			"year": 2019,
			"typeID": 1,
			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Nowadays, several interfaces for End-User Development (EUD) empower end users to jointly program the behavior of their smart devices and online services, typically through trigger-action rules. Despite their popularity, such interfaces often expose too much functionality, and force user to search among a large number of supported technologies disposed in confused grid menus. This paper contributes to the EUD with the aim of interactively assisting end users in composing IF-THEN rules with an optimizer in the loop. The goal, in particular, is to automatically redesign the layout of EUD interfaces to facilitate users in defining triggers and actions. For this purpose, a) we define a predictive model to characterize the composition of trigger-action rules on the basis of their final functionality; b) we adapt different optimization algorithms to explore the design space; and c) we present EUDoptimizer, the integration of our approach in IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD interfaces.We demonstrate that good layout solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, an empirical evaluation with 12 end users show evidence that EUDoptimizer reduces the efforts needed to compose trigger-action rules.",

			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "Semantic technologies and Linked Data are increasingly adopted as core application modules, in many knowledge domains and involving various stakeholders: ontology engineers, software architects, doctors, employees, etc. Such a diffusion calls for better access to models and data, which should be direct, mobile, visual and time effective. While a relevant core of research efforts investigated the problem of ontology visualization, discovering different paradigms, layouts, and interaction modalities, a few approaches target mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. \r\nTouch interaction, indeed, has the potential of dramatically improving usability of Linked Data and of semantic-based solutions in real-world applications and mash-ups, by enabling direct and tactile interactions with involved knowledge objects. \r\nIn this paper, we move a step towards touch-based, mobile interfaces for semantic models by presenting an ontology browsing platform for Android devices. We exploit state of the art touch-based interaction paradigms, e.g., pie menus, pinch-to-zoom, etc., to empower effective ontology browsing. Our research mainly focuses on interactions, yet providing support to different visualization approaches thanks to a clear decoupling between model-level operation and visual representations.\r\nPresented results include the design and implementation of a working prototype application, as well as a first validation involving habitual users of semantic technologies. Results show a low learning curve and positive reactions to the proposed paradigms, which are perceived as both innovative and useful.",

			"typeID": 22,
			"description": "4.1 Contributo in Atti di convegno",
			"abstract": "End users can nowadays define applications in the format of IF-THEN rules to personalize their IoT devices and online services. Along with the possibility to compose such applications, however, comes the need to debug them, e.g., to avoid unpredictable and dangerous behaviors. In this context, different questions are still unexplored: which visual languages are more appropriate for debugging IF-THEN rules? Which information do end users need to understand, identify, and correct errors? To answer these questions, we first conducted a literature analysis by reviewing previous works on end-user debugging, with the aim of extracting design guidelines. Then, we developed My IoT Puzzle, a tool to compose and debug IF-THEN rules based on the Jigsaw metaphor. My IoT Puzzle interactively assists users in the debugging process with different real-time feedback, and it allows the resolution of conflicts by providing textual and graphical explanations. An exploratory study with 6 participants preliminary confirms the effectiveness of our approach, showing that the usage of the Jigsaw metaphor, along with real-time feedback and explanations, helps users understand and fix conflicts among IF-THEN rules.",

			"title": "On the Impact of Dysarthric Speech on Contemporary ASR Cloud Platforms",
			"year": 9999,
			"typeID": 1,
			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "The spread of voice-driven devices has a positive impact for people with disabilities in smart environments, since such devices allow them to perform a series of daily activities that were difficult or impossible before. As a result, their quality of life and autonomy increase. However, the speech recognition technology employed in such devices becomes limited with people having communication disorders, like dysarthria. People with dysarthria may be unable to control their smart environments, at least with the needed proficiency; this problem may negatively affect the perceived reliability of the entire environment.\r\nBy exploiting the TORGO database of speech samples pronounced by people with dysarthria, this paper compares the accuracy of the dysarthric speech recognition as achieved by three speech recognition cloud platforms, namely IBM Watson Speech-to- Text, Google Cloud Speech, and Microsoft Azure Bing Speech. Such services, indeed, are used in many virtual assistants deployed in smart environments, such as Google Home. The goal is to investigate whether such cloud platforms are usable to recognize dysarthric speech, and to understand which of them is the most suitable for people with dysarthria.\r\nResults suggest that the three platforms have comparable performance in recognizing dysarthric speech, and that the accuracy of the recognition is related to the speech intelligibility of the person. Overall, the platforms are limited when the dysarthric speech intelligibility is low (80-90% of word error rate), while they improve up to reach a word error rate of 15-25% for people without abnormality in their speech intelligibility.",

			"title": "RecRules: Recommending IF-THEN Rules for End-User Development",
			"year": 9999,
			"typeID": 1,
			"description": "1.1 Articolo in rivista",
			"abstract": "Nowadays, end users can personalize their smart devices and web applications by defining or reusing IF-THEN rules through dedicated End-User Development (EUD) tools. Despite apparent simplicity, such tools present their own set of issues. The emerging and increasing complexity of the Internet of Things, for example, is barely taken into account, and the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions of different smart devices and web applications is continuously growing. Such a large design space makes end-user personalization a complex task for non-programmers, and motivates the need of assisting users in easily discovering and managing rules and functionality, e.g., through recommendation techniques. In this paper, we tackle the emerging problem of recommending IF-THEN rules to end users by presenting RecRules, a hybrid and semantic recommendation system. Through a mixed content and collaborative approach, the goal of RecRules is to recommend by functionality: it suggests rules based on their final purposes, thus overcoming details like manufacturers and brands. The algorithm uses a semantic reasoning process to enrich rules with semantic information, with the aim of uncovering hidden connections between rules in terms of shared functionality. Then, it builds a collaborative semantic graph, and it exploits different types of path-based features to train a learning to rank algorithm and compute top-N recommendations. We evaluate RecRules through different experiments on real user data extracted from IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD tool. Results are promising: they show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms, and open the way for a new class of recommender systems for EUD that take into account the actual functionality needed by end users.",
